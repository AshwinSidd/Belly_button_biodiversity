**Project Details**

This project was basicaly to create engaging and dynamic charts which would help identify the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize bellies. Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not. The idea is to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
